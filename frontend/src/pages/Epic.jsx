        EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) is a 10-channel
        spectroradiometer onboard NOAAâ€™s DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory)
        spacecraft. EPIC provides 10 narrow band spectral images of the entire
        sunlit face of Earth using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device)
        detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope. The DSCOVR
        spacecraft is located at the Earth-Sun Lagrange-1 (L-1) point giving
        EPIC a unique angular perspective that will be used in science
        applications to measure ozone, aerosols, cloud reflectivity, cloud
        height, vegetation properties, and UV radiation estimates at Earth.
